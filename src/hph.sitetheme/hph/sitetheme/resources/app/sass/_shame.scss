// Shame CSS
//
// If it’s a hack, it goes in shame.css.
// 1. Document all hacks fully:
// 1.1. What part of the codebase does it relate to?
// 1.2. Why was this needed?
// 1.3. How does this fix it?
// 1.4. How might you fix it properly, given more time?
// 2. Do not blame the developer; if they explained why they had to do it then
// their reasons are probably (hopefully) valid.
// 3. Try and clean shame.css up when you have some down time.
// 3.1 Even better, get a tech-debt story in which you can dedicate actual sprint time to it.
